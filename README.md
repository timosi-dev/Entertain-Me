"npm run preview"

To be implemented: 
1. Persist filter and search data into session Storage.
2. Specify vote number, as it affects ratings.
2. Implement streaming platforms in the filtering, so that user can specify which platform they have and filter with it.
   This should also have country filter. because streaming platforms content can be different in different countries.
3. Create user authentication and user profiles
4. Each user can create collections or watchlists for each movies they want to watch for. and they would be able to share the list with their friends.
   Or have shared lists where friends can contribute.
   They can also set alarms and get notifications when the new season or movie comes out that they put in the specific collection.
